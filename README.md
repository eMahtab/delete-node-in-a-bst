# Delete node in a Binary Search Tree(BST)
## https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-bst

Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

Search for a node to remove.
If the node is found, delete the node.

**Note: Time complexity should be O(height of tree).**

```
Example:

root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
key = 3

    5
   / \
  3   6
 / \   \
2   4   7

Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.

One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the following BST.

    5
   / \
  4   6
 /     \
2       7

Another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7].

    5
   / \
  2   6
   \   \
    4   7
```
## Implementation :

```java
class Solution {
  /*
  One step right and then always left
  */
  public int successor(TreeNode root) {
    root = root.right;
    while (root.left != null) root = root.left;
    return root.val;
  }

  /*
  One step left and then always right
  */
  public int predecessor(TreeNode root) {
    root = root.left;
    while (root.right != null) root = root.right;
    return root.val;
  }

  public TreeNode deleteNode(TreeNode root, int key) {
    if (root == null) return null;

    // delete from the right subtree
    if (key > root.val) root.right = deleteNode(root.right, key);
    // delete from the left subtree
    else if (key < root.val) root.left = deleteNode(root.left, key);
    // delete the current node
    else {
      // the node is a leaf
      if (root.left == null && root.right == null) root = null;
      // the node is not a leaf and has a right child
      else if (root.right != null) {
        root.val = successor(root);
        root.right = deleteNode(root.right, root.val);
      }
      // the node is not a leaf, has no right child, and has a left child    
      else {
        root.val = predecessor(root);
        root.left = deleteNode(root.left, root.val);
      }
    }
    return root;
  }
}
```
